# ReadBar
A very basic barcode reader for use when the user needs to check when two or more barcodes match.

In many circumstances it is important to check that a number of objects are all members of the same set. If the objects are labelled with barcodes, a user can read the barcodes and confirm they are all the same. This app enables users to read a number of one-D barcodes (the default type it reads is org.iso.Code39), and either confirms they are all identical, or warns the user that they are not.

The iOS prototype app was created at the January 2017 NHS HackDay at Cardiff using LiveCode (www.livecode.com & www.livecode.org). More polish will follow, as will an Android version.
